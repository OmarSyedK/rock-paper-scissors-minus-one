# Rock Paper Scissors Minus One
A variation of Rock Paper Scissors featured in Squid Game season 2. Similar to the traditional game, you choose between three options except you have two hands. After both players pick two hands, each removes one, and the winner is decided with the normal rules. The game is built with JavaScript to handle choice selection, opponent choice randomization, score tracking, and resetting each round.
